  # Snapcast server setup for a TCP Server stream. If you have multiple devices and wish to
  # be able to stream from multiple devices simultaneously, each will need setup with their

## You need to add your proper Ethernet config based on the board you are using. You can see a list of known boards here:
##    https://esphome.io/components/ethernet/
## The information below is for the Olimex ESP32-GATEWAY and LILYGO TTGO T-Internet-POE ESP32-WROOM LAN8270A:
ethernet:
  type: LAN8720
  mdc_pin: GPIO23
  mdio_pin: GPIO18
  clk:
    pin: GPIO17
    mode: CLK_OUT
  phy_addr: 0

## OPTIONALLY, enable transport encryption for the API layer by uncommenting the following lines 
## and replacing "REPLACE_BY_32_BIT_RANDOM_KEY" with a 32-character random key.
## For more information, refer to the ESPHome documentation:
## https://esphome.io/components/api.html
## Note: The documentation also provides a tool to generate a random key
